# ICEBOUND VR

This is a short, explorational VR Game where the player is one of the scientists stationed at the research lab on a snowy mountain. The lab is part of a larger research project funded by a private corporation, aimed at studying a new energy source, using a unique crystal found only in this region of the mountain. The experiments went wrong, causing a chain reaction that triggered the snowstorm and destroyed the research station. The lab has been set up in a remote location to avoid any interference from outsiders, and the scientists have been given a lot of freedom in their research. However, things have started to go wrong in the lab, and the player wakes up to find that a snowstorm has damaged the lab and all of the equipment. The other scientists are missing, and the player has lost their memory due to some sort of accident.

The player's objective is to explore the snowy mountain and the lab, find clues about what happened, and try to piece together their memories. Along the way, the player will encounter obstacles and challenges that they will need to overcome to progress. The ultimate objective is to find out what caused the lab to be damaged, and what happened to the other scientists, and ultimately escape the mountain. But the thing is he never escapes the mountain. Once he figures out who he is and what happened, his memories gets deleted somehow and he goes back to the beginning of the game.

## Clues

There are two different clue objects in the game. The first one is a voice recorder, which plays the voice recordings of the conversation between the scientists (which was recorded using Voice.ai and edited using FL Studio), and the second one is a Datalog. Player can get these from weather stations there are planted across the map.
